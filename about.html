                I am very interested in exploring and learning about new aspects and concepts of technology. I really love to code and so far I have
                learnt QBASIC, Visual Basic, HTML, Java, Python and SQL. Apart from coding, my other favourite hobbies and past-times are dancing, listening to music
                and photography.
